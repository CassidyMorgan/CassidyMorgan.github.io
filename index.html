												<h3>Self-Assessment</h3>
												<p>Completing the program coursework and developing the ePortfolio has helped showcase my ability to create and design software applications for stakeholders, add algorithms and data structures to a program, and modify databases to store information securely while working in a collaborative environment. During the computer science program, I have worked in every role of a development team including the product owner, project manager, team leader, developers, and QA analysts. I’ve learned how each role is both necessary and valuable to every other role considering how they play off one another and what they add to the team. I was taught how to communicate with stakeholders through various meetings to better understand the project requirements, the use cases that are associated with them, and to ensure that any progression is following the stakeholders’ vision.
												</p>
												<p>I have learned how to implement data structures such as arrays, lists, trees, stacks, hash tables, and graphs to provide efficiency and reusability to a program. This is shown with the graph algorithm in the weight tracking application that displays the user’s weight progression. I now understand how to use the Software Development Life Cycle to create programs while using specific components and following defined constraints as demonstrated through the creation of a travel agency’s web application where the user could choose the type of vacation that they would like to experience. I have learned how to develop databases to store information such as user credentials and data as shown in the weight tracking app. It was also demonstrated in a dog search and rescue application that used animal shelter database information to search for specific dogs that would be ideal for search and rescue. Throughout the program, I have also learned how to use secure coding practices such as using loops to validate user input as taught in my secure coding course.

											<h3>Weight Tracking Application</h3>
											<p>The weight tracking application initially created in CS 360 Mobile Architect and Programming is the artifact that was chosen for the enhancements. It was originally created from October through December of 2021. This application originally consisted of four screens and five classes which included a login class, a registration class, a user weight class, a database class, and a non-functional notification class. The database had only two tables. The improvements made revolved around software engineering and design, algorithm and data structure, and database concepts. </p>

											<h3>Software Design & Engineering</h3>
											<p>For the software design and engineering portion, the project’s complexity was enhanced with the addition of graphics, more fields and features, and an updated UI. I completed course outcome “design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts” by providing new features to select gender, set weight, and set height to a new BMI calculator with corresponding graphics to accompany them and added comments to each section of code to describe their functions. I achieved the course outcome “demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals” by using Android Studio to implement the enhancements and making the application more valuable with the addition of the BMI calculator. The course outcome “develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources” was implemented using if/else loops to verify and validate user inputs. These enhancements demonstrated a total of three course outcomes revolving around software design and engineering concepts.</p>

											<h3>Algorithms & Data Structures</h3>
											<p>For the algorithm and data structures portion, the addition of a graphing algorithm was implemented to display the user’s weight progression. I achieved course outcome “design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choice” by using graphing principles and functions to find reachable nodes and insert them to the graph. Course outcome “demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals” was also achieved through the implementation of a new database table to hold the graph’s “x” and “y” values. The database contains added functions that allow the values to be grabbed and sorted before display. These enhancements encompassed a total of two of the course outcomes and related to data structures and algorithms. </p>

											<h3>Databases</h3>
											<p>For the database portion of the enhancements, tables to store goal weights, graph information, and phone numbers were added. I achieved course outcome “employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science” by identifying the need to split the user weight table, which held goal weights and the user’s current weight and date, in two. Now one table holds goal weights and the other stores the user’s current weight and date. This expedited output and increased the efficiency of the system. Course outcome “demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals” was achieved with the addition of the graph table which showcased the ability to mine data by collecting user weight and date information and displaying it on a line graph to expose user weight trends. It was also shown in the ability to store user information such as their phone number which could be used for future data mining purposes. These enhancements displayed a total of two course outcomes that revolved around database techniques. </p>

											<h3>Justification Narrative</h3>
											<p>
												There are several reasons that this artifact is being included in the ePortfolio. The first reason this artifact is being included in the ePortfolio is because it is my greatest achievement during my time here at SNHU. The second reason is because I really enjoyed working on this project and plan to ultimately add it to the Android App Store. The third reason is because there are several enhancements that can be made on it. The fourth reason it is being included is because it showcases front-end development skills.
											</p>
											<p>
												Each portion of the ePortfolio present different technical skills and abilities in the computer science field. The specific components that showcase my skills and abilities in software development include the addition of more screens, buttons, graphics, and a new and improved UI. A screen to calculate a user’s BMI was added with buttons to select gender, set height, set weight, and set age. The specific components of the artifact that showcase my skills and abilities in algorithms and data structure are the graph algorithms, database tables, and graph functions. There is the addition of a database table to store phone numbers, validation loops, data structures for notifications, and updated backgrounds to show consistency throughout the application display skills and abilities relating to databases.
											</p>
											<p>
												The process of enhancing the artifact took a lot of trial and error. Most of the challenges I faced were related to operator errors. I had some complications finding the required fixes to errors in my code so that it worked as intended. I also had trouble getting the graph database table to accept the current date as input. It was originally defaulting to 12/31/1969. I found that it was because I was using the epoch date constructor rather than the default date constructer (new Date()) which gives the current day/time stamp. While running into problems can be frustrating at times, figuring out a solution that works is very rewarding.
